LiquidLab MVC Application
Developed by Matthew Blough-Wayles
Created 12/19/2016

This application is a learning implementation of the Model-View-Controller Java Design Pattern. The Model class interacts with a database to
store and retrieve e-Liquid recipes from an included database. The View is responsible for interacting with the user, displaying recipes
requested by the user, and allowing the user to create new recipes.
