LiquidLab MVC Application
Developed by Matthew Blough-Wayles
Created 12/19/2016

This application is a learning implementation of the Model-View-Controller Java Design Pattern. The Model class interacts with a database to
store and retrieve e-Liquid recipes from an included database. The View is responsible for interacting with the user, displaying recipes
requested by the user, and allowing the user to create new recipes.


*Future feature: Implement the ability to create a grocery list of flavors. Include a button or link next to individual flavors allowing the user to report that they have run out of that specific flavor. Have it add to sort of a 'grocery list', possibly another table in the database? Additionally, any product containing that flavor should go red in the drop-down menu

*I want a way to know what the main ingredient of a product is without having to click on it and review. For instance, I don't want to have to click on BDPL and then El Nido to know that they are both lemonade-based flavors. Flavor grouping may be beneficial.

*Eventually get a raspberry pi to supply me with the flavors I need ;)
